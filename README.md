# Model-Car-Parking-Garage
For a midterm assignment for my mechatronics class, I made a model parking garage out of electronics and Lego for small model cars. The parking garage has a six-digit binary password input and parking space sensors to control which and how many cars are in the parking lot at a time. This project showcases the basics of mechatronics.
